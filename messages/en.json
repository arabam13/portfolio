    "title": "About Me",
    "paragraph": "After graduating with a degree in Statistic and Business Intelligence, and working in the data analysis field, I decided to pursue my passion for IT programming. I've enrolled in a WEB development program and learned full-stack WEB development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.JS, Angular, Node.JS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I am also familiar with TypeScript, Prisma, and Reactive Programming (Rxjs library of Angular). I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer. When I'm not coding, I enjoy practicing sport, going to the gym, travelling, watching movies, and playing with my daughter, who is my source of inspiration. I also enjoy learning new things."
